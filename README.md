# Intro to Databases: Final Project

This project was built using open-source software USBwebserver v8.6, because it meets the project requirements of making a PHP based website with a MySQL database.

It can be easily deployed offline and doesn't require any installation, good for quick demos.

Directory breakdown:

- The project itself is in the "usbwebserver/" folder.
- The "PHP Files" folder contains a copy of all the PHP and HTML code I made. These are also found in the "usbwebserver/root/" folder
- "database_course_evaluations_project.sql" file contains the MySQL code for the database which was exported from phpmyadmin.
- The diagram png images show the schema and relational dependencies in the SQL database, which was planned out before making the website application.
- The pdf report shows how to use the application via usbwebserver, how to navigate the site, explains the features, and includes images.

*Please note that the course evaluation part of the website is currently empty since the database is expected to be updated every semester with new class information. The pdf report contains images of what it should look like and function.
